AI-Powered Directory Management System
Introduction
The AI-Powered Directory Management System is an intelligent file management solution designed to automate directory organization, search, and categorization using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). With the increasing volume of digital files, manual file organization becomes inefficient and time-consuming. This system enhances file accessibility, reduces manual effort, and optimizes storage usage by utilizing AI-driven automation and data visualization techniques.

Key Features
✅ AI-Based File Categorization – Automatically classifies files into categories (e.g., documents, images, code files).
✅ Predictive Search – Enhances file search with intelligent suggestions based on usage patterns.
✅ Duplicate File Detection – Identifies and removes redundant files to save storage.
✅ User-Friendly Graphical Interface – Provides an interactive UI for easy navigation and file management.
✅ Data Visualization & Analytics – Generates reports and insights on file structure, usage trends, and storage optimization.
